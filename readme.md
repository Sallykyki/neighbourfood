# Redesigning NeighbourFood Website

01 October 2017

## 1 Introduction

NeighbourFood is a start-up company which provides a peer to peer service. The objective
is to correct the imbalance between hunger and wasted food. For a start-up company, a
website plays an important role which helps the company market its product and increases
the brand visibility and awareness. Recognizing these facts, I decided to implement the
redesigning NeighbourFood website to accurately reflect the company objective as well as
improve the business.

This report covers the redesigning of NeighbourFood website. It indicates the problems of
the current design and delivers a new design which is applied the design principles. The
theory is mainly based on the book “The principle of beautiful web design” by Jason
Beaird.

The technique used to implement the new website is Bootstrap framework. The objective
is to bring about a responsive website which meets the usability angle as well as the aesthetic 
perspective. Besides, improving the SEO’s ranking is concerned while implementing.

## 2 The current website performance

The issues need to be improved:

- Above the fold, there is not enough content to show to the objective of the website.
- There is no balance among the columns in the footer section.`
- The speed of the page is poor due to the images loading time.
- The page is unstable due to the usage of technology.
- The site is lack of content.
- SEO is not implemented.


## 3 The new website design

Layout and composition

I used the 960 Grid System with 12 columns. The landing page is divided into 4 sections including header, 
product, team and footer. The header which is above the fold contains main navigation and description of
the product. The layout is unified by using the proximity and repetition.

The key features are arranged based on the symmetrical balance: each column has the
same elements.


Button is emphasized by using the contrast method. The concept of this method is: the
greater the difference between a graphic element and its surroundings, the more that element will stand out. The button is a focal point that I want visitors to click on a page, it is known as a call to action.

Color

The dominants colors of the website are green and white. Because I desire that my webpage
brings about freshness and elegance. Green is most commonly associated with nature.
It’s a soothing color that symbolizes growth, freshness, and hope. Visually, green is much
easier on the eyes and far less dynamic. And green is a versatile color that can also rep-
resent stability which helps my company speak for sustainable living.

Typography

The slogan “Act local, help global” is used large typeface to make impression on users at
the first time. The font style is Dancing script. It evokes an elegant feel and reader usually
characterize it as beautiful, relaxed, quiet and happy.

The body text is used Open Sans font style. Open Sans was designed with an upright
stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web,


and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms. Hence,
it is a perfect match for the body text.

The font size is hierarchical: the title, headings are bigger than the body. That means the big-
ger, the more important.

Texture

I used the icon to represent the key features of the application. The primary goal of using
icons should be to help the user absorb and process information more efficiently. Using
icons well enriches even minimal content by giving it more substance, enabling effective
communication without wordiness. They are used to draw attention to the content.

Imagery

The image of an iPhone and an Android phone indicates that the application is available
on iOS and Android operation. Besides, several decent food photos encourage visitors to explore the application.

### 4 Implementation

The website is built from scratch using Bootstrap framework. It is free and open-source
front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML-
and CSS-based design for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface
components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. The advantage of this framework
is that it helps to build a responsive site easily and quickly.

The green circle in background screen is created using SVG. SVG is used to define vector-based 
graphics for the Web. It defines the graphics in XML format. SVG graphics do
not lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized. Every element and every attribute in
SVG files can be animated.

Besides, using meta tag in HTML is proposed to enhance the Search Engine Optimization
ranking in early steps.

```
<meta name=" author " content="NeighbourFood Ltd">
<meta name=" description " content="NeighbourFood is peer to peer ser-
vice. The application connects the home chefs who cook too much too
much food or just love to share food and the hungry people.">
<meta name=" keywords " content="act local, help global, neighbourFood
app, food sharing, save food, end hunger">
<title>NeighbourFood</title>
```

## 5 Conclusion

In conclusion, making a beautiful website is a giant process. It requires not only the design
skills but also the programming skills. The design principles help the designer to make
aesthetically pleasing and practical design decisions. But the most important attribute you
can bring to the design is your own personality, experiences and interested. Further-
more, web development skills are essential to turn a design into a real webpage smoothly.

things and keep practising, you will absolutely achieve success.
